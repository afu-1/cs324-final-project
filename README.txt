What the project is:
Group Flappy Dino has created a game called "Flappy Dino," which takes inspiration from Google Chrome's Offline Dinosaur game and the mobile game "Flappy Bird." The user will have to control the movement of a flying dinosaur in order to avoid red projectiles by using the up and down arrow keys. If dinosaur touches a red projectile, the game ends.

How to import Minim:
1) The user will need to have Minim imported into Processing to make the audio functionality work. To do this, first open Processing.
2) Click on "Sketch" at the very top of the Processing window.
3) A drop-down menu should appear. Click "Import Library".
4) A drop-down menu should appear to the side. Click "Add Library".
5) A window titled "Contribution Manager" should appear. The "Libraries" tab should automatically be selected. If not, click on the "Libraries" tab. In the search bar, type in "Minim".
6) "Minim" should appear in the results. Click on it, then click the "Install" button in the bottom right corner of the "Contribution Manager" window.
7) Once you have Minim installed, restart Processing.

How to run the file "flappydino_finalproject.pde":

How to play:
