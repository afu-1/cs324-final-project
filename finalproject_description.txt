Annie: I was in charge of creating the colors dataset and scores class. For the colors dataset, I first created a JSON file to contain the color values. However, I ran into the issue of transforming the string hexcodes into the actual color integer so I resorted to changing the values into their RGB number values. From there, I tried to store the values into local dictionaries (where each RGB value had its own dictionary value) until I realized that a hashmap would be easier for storage. Afterwords, I started to work on the scores dataset where I had to relearn how to create a CSV file. From there, I ran into the challenge of displaying the scores sheet with new input values as a new row would have to coded in. As a result, I decided to create a class that handled all of the new score functionality and the displaying of scores. Theoretically, if the game would be able to reset, then saved high scores would be saved; however, Processing constantly resets the csv files with every time it runs, so it's difficult to transfer over old plays from old runs of the game.
